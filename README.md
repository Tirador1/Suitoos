# Suitoos

This is my project for creating the Suitoos website, an online retailer for size-inclusive suits and tuxedos. I used HTML to structure the content of the site, CSS to style the layout and appearance, and JS for interactivity and functionality. The website features a responsive design for different devices, a user-friendly interface for shopping and browsing, and integration with a mobile app for easy access. I also implemented features such as fabric swatches, group ordering, and free trial options to enhance the customer experience. Overall, I am proud of my work on this project and believe it demonstrates my proficiency in web development using HTML, CSS, and JS.
